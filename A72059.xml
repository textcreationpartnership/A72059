            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And as he more earneſtly ſought after the trueth, he found at the last, that he might no more, vvith a good conſcience, deliuer vnto Gods congregation, the apparant errors of the Papiſts, and therefore reſolued vvith him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to leaue the ſame, and to giue himſelfe vnto the fellovvſhip of the doctrine of the Goſpell.

And for that he had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good vvhile vſed publiquely to Preach, himſelfe thought it very expedient, by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to condemne ſuch euident errors, vvhich he did vvith a vvell meditated Sermon and great deſcretion from his heart,<note place="margin">This reca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

VVherefore vve humbly thanke the Eternall, for that he daily graciouſly calleth his poore ſtrayed ſheepe vnto his heauenly kingdome: and doe further beſeech Almighty God our heauenly Father, to vouchſafe by the vvorking of his holy Spirit, fatherly to ſtrengthen and confirme this <hi>Godefrid,</hi> in the knovvne trueth, mercifully to reduce other ſtrayed ſheepe vnto his ſheepefould, alſo to direct and gouerne his people, and to confound the Romane Antichriſts raging kingdome, euen, for his beloued Sonne Jeſus Christ our Lord his ſake, Amen.

               <p>Well and iuſtly therefore is it ſaid by the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> in the 11. chapter of his booke of <hi>Wiſdome, verſ. 20.21. Lord thou haſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vpon all: for thou haſt power of all things, and makeſt as though thou ſaweſt not the ſinnes of men, becauſe they ſhould amend.

               </p>
               <p>It is much ſaide, and nature alſo teacheth, that parents loue their children exceedingly, and therefore ſometimes are very ſlowe and lothe to take the rodde, although the children haue

               <p>Firſt he rebuketh them with wordes, ſhewes them their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, calles them blinde and deafe.

And this is not done vnto me alone, but for the comfort of all ſinners, whereby they may learne to acknowledge Gods goodneſſe, and amend themſelues.</p>
               <p>Although Gods wayes are not as our wayes, and his thoughts farre otherwiſe then our thoughts; and beſides,<note place="margin">God in the Scriptures hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo much of his will vnto vs as is needfull for vs to know.</note> his counſell is without ſearching out, and alſo we cannot certainely know how God deales with man: yet our louing God hath ſo farre forth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed his will vnto vs in the Scriptures, his holy and diuine word, that we may eaſily know, how and wherewith, God calleth and leadeth vs to his ſheepefolde.</p>

And to the end that we may know which is our true ſhepheards voice, and which Antichriſts, I wil note certaine errors, which Antichriſt the Pope exhorteth the people vnto, and teacheth them as though it were the voyce of Chriſt the true Shepheard: yea he enforceth and conſtraineth the poore little ſheepe, vnto ſuch his idolatrous doctrine with might and maine, that the poore ſilly people muſt imbrace and beleeue ſuch doctrine, as if it were Gods word: and although thereby they be eternally damned, yet dare no man ſay: Pope, why doeſt thou ſo? This is: <hi>Sic volo, ſic iubeo,</hi> wilt thou not,<note place="margin">A doctrine if euer, now care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be obſerued.</note> yet thou ſhalt be conſtrained.

               <p>Let the firſt be the vowing of Friers, whereupon the Popedome ſtandeth faſt grounded,<note place="margin">Popedome ſtandeth vpon Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> wherein Fryers ſweare and vow perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all chaſtitie, voluntary obedience, and voluntary pouerty. And who can ſufficiently declare, how many tong-tyed dumb perſons both men and women, are drawne headlong to hell by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiliſh rope? I call them tong-tied and dumbe, becauſe I know it my ſelfe, &amp; haue had experience in the order, wherin I haue ſpent my time twentie yeares, that the intiſing ouerſeers, haue perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded many a young boy, to make <hi>Profeſſionem,</hi> as they call it.

To conclude, I haue heard ſuch lamentation my ſelfe in Fryeries and Nunneries, that a very hard ſtone, if it had reaſon, could not but pitty them. This la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation proceedeth from the very ſorrow of their hearts, becauſe they can neuer ſee or perceiue, that they euer vowed, or ſwore, vnto ſuch things, as they neuer did keepe, or euer ſhall be able to keepe, for then they well perceiue, it ſtandeth not in their might &amp; powre.</p>
               <p>And to the end alſo certaine big fellowes of ſufficient age,<note place="margin">Frieries the greateſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie and moſt open dore vnto all ſinne, in all degrees.</note> might not take offence at the wicked (I ſhould ſay holy) Fryers life, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters and ſoule deceiuers haue couered the Fryers order, with a faire goulden cloake; as namely: If any man commit a thouſand murders and adulteries, yee haue perpetrated infinite ſinnes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſhould be manifeſted to the world, yet if he do but run into a Monaſtery, and drawe on a Fryers garment, then he hath full remiſſion of all his ſinnes, and no man may lay vpon him paine or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for the ſame. For (ſay they) looke what Baptiſme doth effect vnto little children, that doth a Fryers order vnto the olde knaues. Wherehence it commeth, that ſuch as put on a Friers coate, ſomtimes change their name they receiued in Baptiſme, to ſignifie that they are a new Baptiſed againe. But who ſeeth not heere Sathans craft and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt? There is not one ſillable or letter to be found in the whole holy Scripture, that one ſhould lay vpon any man, after the vowe he hath made vnto the Lord Chriſt in Baptiſme, any ſuch Fryerly vowes, or caſt ſuch a rope about any mans neck. <hi>Paul</hi> indeede ſpeaketh of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie, which he commendeth and praiſeth very highly, &amp; alſo coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth therevnto: but ſaith expreſly; he had no commandement, namely to conſtraine any vnto virginitie, but ſo, that whoſoeuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth in himſelfe, that he hath the grace and gift of cleanneſſe, he ſhould ſo abide &amp; not marry.

Now I haue all this by experience; for I haue bene a confeſſor in poperie theſe thirteene yeeres, and doe know well what vnfit matters oftentimes came to ſcanning and recitall: It is altogeather impoſſible for a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe all his ſinnes, &amp; much leſſe poſſible to know how, when, where, &amp; how often he hath ſinned, ſeeing that the ſcripture recordeth, how that <hi>the righteous man offendeth ſeauen times a day,</hi> and how often then offendeth the poore ſinner?<note place="margin">The firſt error, that mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are thereby inthrauled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted.</note> There are many indeede in poperie that when they come to confeſſion, do as much as in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſible is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare al their ſinnes, and yet when they haue receiued abſolution, and prepared to come to the Lordes Supper, yet if ſuddenly there come a ſinne into their mind which they doubt whether they haue confeſſed or no, they vſe to be ſo exceeding faint &amp; ſorrowfull, that they knowe not whether they may receiue the Lords Supper or no, for they think they ſhould receiue it vnworthely, and ſo a conſcience can haue no peace. And is not this a fearfull abhomination, where mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are ſo martyred and puniſhed?</p>
               <p>Ouer and aboue this,<note place="margin">Second er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that one cannot denounce forgiuenes for all ſinnes.</note> the Pope hath diuided and all to broken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: for ſome he hath reſerued to be by himſelfe forgiuen, which are called <hi>Caſus papales,</hi> ſome he hath graunted vnto Biſhops to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and they are called <hi>Caſus Epiſcopales:</hi> the remainder he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto other ordinarie prieſtes. But beloued, where hath ſuch foolery any ground in Gods worde? Surely in no place, and therefore this is not Chriſtes the true Shepheardes voyce, but Antichriſtes and the Diuelles. As for praying to an inuocation of ſaintes,<note place="margin">Praying vnto ſaints.</note> it is now growne ſo notified that the little children intriuiall ſchooles know it to be agaynſt God, and an Idolatrie, and is againſt the holy peace and ſaluation, as I will proue anon. It is not vniuſt to haue in worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance Gods holines, &amp; therein to praiſe Gods works &amp; Chriſts mercie: for God ſayth himſelfe, <hi>1. Sam. 2. v. 30. Them that honor me, J will honor,</hi> and Chriſt ſayth alſo, <hi>Iohn 12. v. 26. If any man ſerue me, him will my Father honor.</hi> It is therefore not amiſſe to giue vnto Saintes their due prayſe, but to call vpon them as interceſſors and mediators, and to ſeeke for helpe and comfort of them in extremitie, that is agaynſt God, and is properly ſayde to be a ſeeking for ayde of ſtrange Gods. It is written in the olde Teſtament by all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that God calles vs vnto him onely, that he alone is the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:177263:11"/>
and God,<note place="margin">Gods trueth.</note> that will and can helpe vs, that without him there is neither God nor ſaluation, &amp; that he will not giue ſuch honor vnto any other. How louingly and fatherly doth God admoniſh his people in the olde Teſtament, that they ſhoulde not runne ſo after vanitye, but ſhould haue all their refuge vnto him alone? And Chriſt the Sonne of God in like manner cryeth out a maine in many places of the new Teſtament, that we ſhould come vnto him, that he is the true Wel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, that he is the way and the trueth, and that he is our quickning. So the beloued Apoſtles doe alſo nothing els, but onely preach and teach that Chriſt is the Sauiour of the world, that he onely is our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate and interceſſor with the father, that he onely hath waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our ſinnes with his blood, that through him by faith without workes we are and ſhalbe iuſtified before God, and that there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name vnder the ſunne, by which we can or may be ſaued, but by the name of Ieſus. Wherefore it is a great impiety of vs ſinfull men, that haue ſo louing and ſo gracious a God, who is ſo willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to helpe vs, and is able to deliuer vs out of all danger &amp; extremity: &amp; yet we will ſeeke for helpe by others, which haue need themſelues of Gods helpe,<note place="margin">Praying to Saints, is as to God diſhonour, ſo to their owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</note> and without his helpe and grace can neuer be ſaued. For in Popery there is no thing ſo ſmall and of no accoumpt, but they runne to Saints for it, and ſeeke for helpe and counſel of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and is alſo againſt the Saints owne reſt and peace, that we ſhould call vpon them to make interceſſion for vs: howſoeuer <hi>Ierom</hi> reaſoneth thus, ſeeing <hi>Peter, Andrew,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> (ſaith he) whilſt they yet liued vpon earth,<note place="margin">Hieromes error.</note> could obtaine ſome thing for others by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, &amp; ſhould they now be able to do nothing, being in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? They may now much more by their interceſſion win vs, ſeeing their loue is perfected. But I anſwere him, I deny not, that the Saints vpon earth in their life time may pray one for another, &amp; obtain ſomwhat, but do very willingly confeſſe, that one may and ought here tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pray for another, which is according to Gods commaundement. <hi>1. Tim. 2. verſ. 1.2.3. Iam. 5. verſ. 14.15.16.17.18.</hi> But when one is gone from this temporall into eternall life, he takes no longer charge or care ouer vs, neither can helpe vs, for he knoweth there is a God, that both can and will helpe vs. Or if the Saints in heauen doe pray for vs, they muſt neceſſarily knowe our diſtreſſe and afflictions,<note place="margin">The abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth of Hieroms reaſon.</note> for which they pray: for if the Saints in heauen do know our ſorrowes, and if their loue be perfect, then without all doubt they will obſerue the holie apoſtle S. <hi>Paules</hi> rule, which he hath left vnto all men <hi>Rom. 12.

What? is not the Sonne of God then, whom (as they ſay) this ſacrifice ſignifieth, yet ſanctified, is he not yet bleſſed, and is he not as yet accepted of his father? Is not the Sonne one eternall true God, with the Father &amp; the holy Ghoſt? that ſurely they will not deny. And God ſaith, <hi>Leui. 11. v. 44.

            <p>I haue throughly conſidered in my ſelfe the great contentions that haue beene and yet are in Chriſtendom touching religion. I haue caſt the eyes of my minde vpon that mortal hatred, which the greateſt part of the world (and thoſe too, that are the greateſt perſonages) do beare to true religion, and the profeſſors thereof.

            <p>The principall controuerſie at this day is concerning the pure ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God.</p>

               <note place="margin">Exod. 20. Math. 4. Deut. 6. Eſay. 48. Exod. 20.</note> that it is eaſilie ſeene how hee condemneth all ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the Romane Church.

Wherefore I beſeech you, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you in Gods name, and with all the affection of my will, that with a ſpirite of meekeneſſe and feare of God, you doe examine if I haue not done holyly and religiouſly, to laye holde vpon the true word of God, directed thereunto by his ſpirite? And if you finde that it was not my duetie to haue done otherwiſe, then that you would rather (take the ſelfe ſame reſolution in hand, and following my ſteps, direct your courſe to the hauen of eternall life: whereunto I hope to come with all the true
<pb facs="tcp:177263:21"/>
faithfull and elect (then to be moued againſt me and to ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) Before my departure I would gladly haue laide open my deliberation and the reaſons whereon I grounded my ſelfe: I would haue exhorted you to take in hand the ſame reſolution with me, I would haue imbraced you, and witneſſed that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all manner of good vnto you: but the moſt part may then imagin to what great daunger I had expoſed my ſelfe, and the ſmall hope left me to haue profit therein.</p>
            <p>O my Lord Ieſus confirme in me this reſolution, ſuffer me not to yeeld vnto the aſſaults &amp; combats which are or may be made againſt me: helpe my vnbeliefe, increaſe the faith within me, make me conceiue that aſſurance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in hope againſt hope: arme me with thy promiſes, deliuer me from the ſnares of my cruel enimies, make me (good Lord) in effect to feele that thou art with me: &amp; wilt be (as thou haſt aſſured <hi>Abraham</hi>) my moſt liberall guerdon. I ſeeke my ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: giue me, Lord Ieſus an aſſured place of retrait in the holy <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſpare me in the temptations of the worlde: but if it ſhall pleaſe thee to exerciſe me therein, fill me I beſeech thee with the ſpirit of conſtancy, to the end that, finally hauing carried away the victory, I may enter into Paradice with thy moſt happy ſeruants. <hi>Amen.</hi>

brethren, that I haue forſaken the vaine and ſuperſtitious tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men, and diſpoſed my hart to receiue at large the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine beames of the eternall ſunne of iuſtice, the influences of his ſupreame grace, the moſt ſweet ioyes of Gods face, to wit, through the participation of the word of life, of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the Sacraments, of the efficacie of the exercies of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, of the perfections of a liuely faith, and other infinite bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and benefits inſpired from heauen into the elect, in the myſticall ſocietie of the body of Chriſt. O thrice and foure times bleſſed be that ſo great power of the ſpirite of GOD, which leadeth mee to ſuch good, high, and heauenly things. Behold me now through the grace of God to haue forſaken &amp; abandoned theſe ſeminary abuſes of papiſtry, to become forth from the dungeon and ſinke of all filthineſſe &amp; malice. Behold me looſe and freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the embracings of that ſtrumpet <hi>Babel,</hi> the nurſerie of all impietie; by whom the holy name of God is ſo villanouſly prophaned, and the honor of the ſoueraigne God (infinitely iealous of his glory) ſo impudently proſtrated of Idols of gold, ſiluer, ſtone, wood and clay: behold I ſay, how that I am come forth from that dangerous labyrinth of errors, ſo abhominable, as that there is not any man, hauing neuer ſo little feeling of faith, but doth deteſt and abhorre them. My conſcience alſo, which before had ſo many times grieued and tormented me, for that ſhe found her ſelfe ſo far wandring out of the way of the true and liuely ſpirit of God (which ſecretly drew her to himſelfe, affoording her no aſſurance in the falſe grounds, which before ſhe ſought) now giues me a true repoſe and conſolation, hauing found that vnknowne good which ſhe thirſted after: the which is now happened to her, when according to the counſell of the wiſe <hi>(Prou. 14.)</hi> and through the fauour of my GOD, I am <hi>departed from that fooliſhe man,</hi> from the ſonne of iniquitie, from Antichriſt; in whome I haue found no lips of knowledge, but rather of falſhood and deceipt. This is the onely fruite that lyes hidden vnder the leaues of this fained holineſſe, iuſtice, obedience, pouertie, faſtings and diſciplines, inſtituted without and contrarie to
<pb facs="tcp:177263:23"/>
the word of God. All theſe fooleries, theſe proud habilliments and haughty pompe of the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> of Antichriſte, tende to no other ende or vſe, but to buſie, amaze and abuſe the ſence of thoſe who do not know the true celeſtiall ornaments of the citie of the liuing God: which cannot diſcerne the manifeſt difference which the faithfull ſee betweene the crowne of thornes of their Redeemer and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, and the glittering crowne of the ſonne of perdition, ſending men to men, and humaine workes; which are in parte the cauſes of their eternall ſaluation, which to vs and for vs is purchaſed by the onely ſonne of God: to whome he dooth exceeding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury thus to diminiſh, through his falſe doctrine, his merites, and rendring them inſufficient. But if theſe poore ſoules which he amazeth would but enter, how little ſoeuer, into the bottome of their conſciences, to iudge of this his doctrine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vnderſtanding which God worketh in them, I doe aſſure my ſelfe they would ſoone diſcouer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the vanitie and falſhood of this deceiuer. For GOD dooth ſuffer by his ſecret (but moſt iuſt) prouidence, that the more they haue their eyes open to their workes, as expecting by them ſaluation, ſo much the more are they doubtfull, fearefull and in deſpaire; what ſhew or apparance ſoeuer the bountie and greatneſſe of their workes carrye with them: which doubtleſſe is a worke which God worketh in them for good, if they would not wilfully reſiſt the holy Ghoſt. I ſpeake this by experience which I haue in my ſelfe, and in a great number of others, whoſe inward diſpoſition hath beene very well knowne to me. And ſurely this curſed teacher of lyes &amp; inuenter of fooleries, dooth diſhonour and outrage to the bleſſed ſonne of God, not onely in this which hath beene ſaid, but alſo moſt vnworthily and outragiouſly deueſteth him of all his other dignities and excellencies, wherewith he hath beene honoured by his eternall father, though in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hee qualifieth him the Sauiour and redeemer of the world: but it is in ſuch ſort, as that in effect, and as much as in him lyeth, hee depriueth and robbeth him of all that which
<pb facs="tcp:177263:24"/>
is neceſſarie for ſuch an office. And firſt, what is he ſo blinde, that ſeeth not plainely how he diſpoſſeſſeth him of his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and perpetuall office of Sacrificer, ſeeing he giues him, coadiutors and ſucceſſors in this kinde of office, which are the Prieſtes:<note place="margin">Chriſt dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</note> who according as he vainely conceiues, doe againe daylie ſacrifice the ſonne of GOD, offering him to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall father for the expiation of the ſinnes of the worlde. And what, I pray you, meanes he by this, but that hee reputeth the onely ſacrifice of the ſonne of GOD, the true defacer of all our offences, to be of ſo ſmall power, and vertue, that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capeable and vnſufficent to deface them for euer? And againe is not this preferring of the Prieſt, ſaying Maſſe, or ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing (a mortall and ſinnefull creature, whoſe lippes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed) before the bleſſed Sonne of GOD, Chriſt Ieſus, a Lambe without ſpotte, in whom there is found no guile nor ſinne? ſeeing that euery ſacrifice is receaued in reſpect of the Sacrificer, as it is written in <hi>Gen. 4. The eternall had reſpect to Abel and his offering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I omit for breuitie ſake a thouſand other abſurdities, that followe after this newe ſacrifice of the Maſſe, and likewiſe, a whole worlde of horrible and moſt abhominable villanies, which are to be found in the order of theſe Sacrificers, as well regular as ſecular: which ſufficiently declare, of what ſtuffe both themſelues and their ſacrifice are made.</p>
            <p>I will not heere ſaye any thing of the groſſe and beaſtlye ignorance which is in many, though they be reſpected and honoured like great Doctors of the people and gouernours of ſoules; which (blinded as they are) they leade with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into the pit of perdition.</p>
            <p>I neede not likewiſe to make knowne to you the vitious life and ſcandalous conuerſation,<note place="margin">Of Monks and their liues.</note> and too too notorious of the religious, and Monkes, meere abuſers of the people; who in Cloiſters and Monaſtaries are nouriſhed in idleneſſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with the labour and ſweate of the poore and ſimple people: who conceiuing too good an opinion of them, doe
<pb facs="tcp:177263:24"/>
oftentimes take the very breade out of their owne mouthes, to giue it to them, which they abuſe ouer wantonly through exceſſe and gluttony.</p>
            <p>But to returne to their chiefe leader &amp; Patriarche; Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this deceiuour vſurpeth ſupreame authoritie ouer the lawes, doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and documents of the ſonne of God accuſing them of inſufficiencie, and lacke of power to demonſtrate vnto vs the Soueraigne good, ſaying in a worde that the holy Scriptures are imperfect; what doth he elſe then depriue him of his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torall robe.</p>
            <p>But the truth is and ſo it behoues vs to beleeue aſſuredly, that as Chriſt Ieſus hath ſent vs from the euerlaſting Father, as a moſt wiſe Maiſter, with charge and power to bring men to their ſaluation: ſo hath he likewiſe by his doctrine, laide open moſt ſufficiently the way and meanes therevnto.<note place="margin">Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:</note> Whereby certainely is ouerthrowne all the hoſt of traditions, all this Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade and infinite number of humaine inuentions, and vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doctrines, forged in the ſhoppe of this deceiuer:<note place="margin">Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Scriptures.</note> by the which he doth not onely ſurpaſſe, but is alſo contrary and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, to the deuine and wholeſome doctrine and precepts of Chriſt Ieſus, a moſt ſufficient Maiſter and teacher, the true Meſſias, both God &amp; man;<note place="margin">Pope is Antichriſt.</note> accompliſhing that which S. <hi>Paule</hi> foretolde of him, that he ſhould oppoſe and lift vppe himſelfe againſt all that, which is called God. <hi>2.

            <p>Hence it comes, that this proud and arrogant deceiuer,<note place="margin">Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſaints.</note> takes vpon him to make Saints, to canoniſe thoſe that ſeeme good vnto him, deifying them in ſuch ſort, as that the ſiely ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people cannot know nor diſcerne Chriſt Ieſus among this rable of ſaints: and eftſoons it falleth out that the bodies of thoſe are honored and ſuperſtitiouſly adored by men in

As for my part, I am weary and tired therewith: and therefore I renounce her, I deteſt and abiure her, in the preſence of this Church of God, both now and for euer; louing rather to endure the Croſſe of Chriſt in the boſome of his lawfull ſpouſe, then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the pleaſures and ioyes of this world, betweene the armes of a ſhameleſſe ſtrumpet, who hath ſo long time deceiued me through her fooleries. But againe I renounce and abiure now and for euer, both her and all her doctrine; in ſo much as that it is againſt the expreſſe word of God, blaſphematory, Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, ſuperſtitious, and as farre from the meaning of Chriſte our true maiſter, as darkeneſſe from light, as falſhood from trueth, &amp; vice from vertue: moſt humbly beſeeching almighty GOD (thorough the entralls of his mercy, and through the
<pb facs="tcp:177263:25"/>
moſt precious bloude which his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt hath ſhed for me) that he will not lay to my charge the faults of my youth nor iudge me according to the ſinnes of my ignorance; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purſuing his mercy begunne in me, he will pardon all my offences committed by me either in works, words or thoughts, and in others, through examples and wicked ſuperſtitious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines: and that it would pleaſe the ſame God to worke ſo, that thoſe who hetherto haue beene wrapped vp in the palpable darkeneſſe of error and ignorance, and luld a ſleepe vnder the ſhadow of the winges of that ſtrumpet, hauing beene drunke with the wine of her fornication, may now awake out of that profound ſleepe, and ſlumber of death, to taſt how little ſoeuer it be of the ſauourous fruite of life, and drinke onely a glaſſe of the delitious waters of the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines of immortallity, which ſtreame from the houſe of God, into the aſſembly of the elect: for then I do aſſure my ſelfe, they will forthwith abandon the venomous Ciſterns of that defiled ſtrumpet and moſt malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deceiuer. For this end therefore, O mercifull father and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting God, we power out before thee, euen from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of our harts, our humble petitions; for that the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we haue of ſo many poore ſoules (which ſhe cauſeth to be drunke, &amp; poyſoned with a deadly poyſon, couered ouer with an agreeable ſweetnes) makes our eyes become fountaines, &amp; our harts, to yeld forth vnſpeakable ſighes: conſidering in the theater of the world, the great multitude which through the whirlewinde of ſedition, is rauiſhed, drawne and caried head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the gulfe of perdition. But, O father of light, ſeeing it is thy maner rather to vſe mercy then iuſtice, &amp; that thy will and pleaſure is to vſe fauour, not fury; and that thou doeſt not deſire the death of a ſinner, but that rather he turne to thee and liue: ſtretch forth thy hand ouer them, drawe them to thee, teach them, ſith thy good pleaſure is that all ſhoulde come to the knowledge of ſaluation: Imprint in their ſoules a deſire to founde thy holy Scriptures, and let the diſcretion of thy holy ſpirite leade them togather in theſe gardens fit and neceſſarye hearbs for the phyſick of their ſpirituall infirmities, the foode of their ſoules, the ſacrament of eternity, the certayne pledge
<pb facs="tcp:177263:26"/>
of felicity. But as for me, O father and moſt good God, what ſhall I render vnto thee for thoſe thy exceeding bleſſings beſtowed vppon mee? for like a good ſheepeheard thou haſt ſought after my ſoule, beeing a poore wandering ſheepe, and hauing layde her vpon thy ſhoulders, haſt brought her backe to thy euangelicall ſheepefould, to ioyne her to the flocke of thy true faithfull: thou haſt vnmasked her eyes, layd open to her the abuſes of Papiſtry, made knowne to her where ſhe ſhould finde her reſt and tranquillity, the trueth of her ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: thou haſt forgiuen me all my ſinnes, and healed me of all my infirmities, thou haſt ſaued my life from the pit, thou haſt crowned me with mercy and pitty, and ſatiſfied me with all good things <hi>(Pſal. 130.)</hi> ſo that through this my conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this change, by the power of my Creator, I am made young and luſty as an Eagle: what ſhall I then giue vnto the Lord for al the good which he hath done me? Surely my deare brethren, euen as I eſteeme and holde this to be the chiefeſt &amp; moſt excellent benefit among all thoſe wherwith it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God of his vncomparable bounty and heauenly mercy to make me pertaker: ſo willingly I do acknowledge &amp; confeſſe my ſelfe vnable to render any thing comparable to ſo great a good, yet notwithſtanding, among all thoſe that are bound to yeilde harty thankes to God, I do acknowledge my ſelfe at this time moſt of all indebted. For, alas, without this benefit, what profit ſhould I haue receiued of all the fauours which came from him, but condemnation, ruine &amp; confuſion? What would it haue auailed me that the welbeloued ſon of God, Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus (who became obedient to his father) endured the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious death of the Croſſe, for my reconcilation to God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if I had beene depriued of ſo great a benefit, if I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtil in that ſpirituall fornication wherin I was altogether ignorant of the pure trueth of the Goſpel? What vtility, I pray you, to ſee my ſelfe created after Gods Image and yet to haue borne the portrature &amp; character of beaſt? What profit to haue had the eyes of my bodie open to the outward light, and thoſe of my ſoule debarred of the inward brightneſſe, and beſieged with the darkeneſſe of infidelitie? Ariſe then my ſoule, and
<pb facs="tcp:177263:26"/>
praiſe the Lord, and all that is within me praiſe his holy name: praiſe the Lord O my ſoule, and forget not all his benefits, let his praiſe be alwayes in thy mouth, to the end the meeke and gentle may here it and reioyce. <hi>(Pſal. 103.)</hi> O praiſe the Lorde with me, and let vs magnifie his name together: I ſought the Lord, and he hard me: ye he deliuered me out of all my feare. <hi>Pſal. 34. Iob</hi> did curſe the day of his temporall birth in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable world: but I ought to bleſſe the day of my ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation to eternall life; for that the God of all mercy and conſolation hath cauſed to appeare in me the effects of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall election, acknowledging me for his child of adoption, and for a lawfull heire of that great and eternall kingdome purchaſed for the elect, through the perfect obedience of Chriſt Ieſus their brother: And as at this time I haue abiured that ſtrumpet and her fornication, ſo now I promiſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt before God and his Church, hence forth with all my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to liue and dye in the faith of the Churches reformed, where I ſee the Goſpell purely preached, and the Sacraments faithfully adminiſtred; the confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of whoſe faith I wil ſeale, not only with pen and Inke vpon paper, but alſo through the effuſion of my owne bloud, if need be: and this I fully purpoſe to do through the grace of almighty God, who hath called me to this reſolution, and whome with all the powers of my ſoule I do entirely beſeech to ratifie his vocation in me, &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally (to make me feele the full effects of his election) that he would likewiſe fortifie and aſſiſt me againſt all aſſaults and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that may be preſented againſt me, ſeruing me inſteede of a ſtrong and inuincible buckler in all dangers, both ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and corporall. I earneſtly beſeech the preſent congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the faithfull, to receiue me into their number, to the ende that after I haue fought a good fight with them in this church militant, I may after my departure hence raigne with them in the triumphant. <hi>So be it.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE holy Scripture telleth vs, that the good <hi>Jacob,</hi> ſeeing himſelfe deceiued by <hi>Laban</hi> (who the more he ſerued him, the leſſe was recompenſed, receiuing nought elſe but ingratitude and iniuries) went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lande of promiſe, carrying away with him all his riches: which ſo ſoone as <hi>Laban</hi> vnderſtood, he came to ſeeke him in the Mount <hi>Galaad,</hi> and ſearched or viſited all that which <hi>Iacob</hi> had caryed away: where he found nothing that was his. And afterwardes they made an agreement betweene them, that from thence foorth, the one ſhould not come towardes the other to doe him hurt, and for a token heere of they named this Mountaine <hi>Galaad,</hi> which is to ſay, the hill of Teſtimonie. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, and alſo <hi>Pagnine,</hi> that <hi>Laban</hi> ſignifieth whiteneſſe: and <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> that this word <hi>Laban</hi> ſignifieth colour: ſo that whether it be in the one or other ſignification, it repreſenteth an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall and inconſtant thing. Who is this <hi>Laban?</hi> A deceiuer, a traitor and an vngratefull perſon, who hath ſo oftentimes deceiued <hi>Iacob?</hi> What is this curſed wretch? who hath onely the apparance of good, but no ſolide nor conſtant good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. It is euen this papiſtrie, and Sophiſtrie, which we ſee in theſe tromperies and deceipts of riches, and vnder the title of holineſſe, of obedience, of pouerty, of faſtings, and fained diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, leadeth many to deſpaire. Surely it is a worke of great pietie to flye and retire from her. Foraſmuch as if we beleeue workes to be ſufficient, we muſt wholy deny Ieſus Chriſt, and
<pb facs="tcp:177263:27"/>
ſay that his paſſion was without fruite: which were a ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt. And therefore now doe I purpoſe with all my affection to withdraw me from this <hi>Laban</hi> or idolatrie, (as did the good <hi>Iacob</hi>) with an infallible beliefe that her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are vaine and deceiuing: and I doe knowe my nature to be ſo depraued and corrupted, that it were impoſſible for me to attaine ſaluation through my workes, according to her cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed counſell. And that which I finde more deteſtable is, that notwithſtanding the perfect wiſdom of holy writ, whereunto the Prophets, Euangeliſts, Apoſtles, and the ſacred word of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt doe beare recorde, that in beleeuing them we ſhall haue life euerlaſting (the ſcope of our deſires, and tipe of true felicitie) and contrarywiſe, a curſe, and Anatheme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt thoſe that ſhall eyther thereunto adde or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh, <hi>Apoc. 22.21.</hi> Yet our aduerſaries againſt this celeſtiall trueth (the onely foundation of faith) do approoue a thouſand traditions and vnwritten doctrines,<note place="margin">Humaine traditions.</note> forged vpon a mortall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile in the ſhop of humaine wit. But O prodigious thing, oh monſter of our age, vnknowne to the moſt peruerſe hereticks and fulleſt of impietie! One <hi>Archicoriphee,</hi> and as it were a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke of others, hath not bluſhed to write, nay which is more, to imprint and publiſh (not without horrible blaſphemie) a little Treatiſe of the inſufficiencie of the Scriptures.<note place="margin">Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of the ſcriptures.</note> Where is then the perfection of them which is ſo highly commended by the Apoſtle, who ſaith; <hi>It is not permitted to know aboue that which is written. 1.

Surely it were ſacriledge to thinke it, and Atheiſme to beleeue it. Alas, what would become of ſo many religious ſoules, ſince the worldes infancie, vnacquainted altogether with the inuentions of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Biſhops, brought forth but ſince a few forepaſſed ages: Let vs aſſure our ſelues, that that which is the firſt, whether it be prophecie, or the written goſpell, is moſt true and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſaluation: otherwiſe what ſhould wee beleeue, where
<pb facs="tcp:177263:28"/>
ſhould we ground our ſelues, whereon would our faith laye holde, if we ſhould follow mans inuentions? Euery man is a lyer, and curſed be he that truſteth in the arme of fleſh. Men would teach againſt Gods worde, that the ſonne of man, God and man,<note place="margin">Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</note> is vnder the forme bread, in the pretended ſacrifice of the Maſſe: that his body is made of bread, or at leaſt that the ſubſtance of bread is changed into him: that he is to be ſought for betweene the hands of the Sacrificer. Good God what abſurditie is it to ſeeke the father of eternitie, the creator of the world, who hath the heauens for his throne (reſpecting his diuinitie) and who according to humane nature, ſits on the right hand of the father, from whence he ſhall come viſibly to iudge the quick and the dead, to ſeeke him I ſay, as great as he was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe, cloſed within a little morſell of dowe, leſſe than halfe a foote. Should he be found where he is not? What blindneſſe trow you is this? Let vs rather ſeeke him where he aduertiſed vs that he would retire himſelfe, and prepare a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent habitation for thoſe that are his: he alone is a faithfull witneſſe, he alone is our Doctor to reueale his ſecrets. Let vs go to the law of grace, to the goſpel that ſpeaketh plainly and certainly hereof. What is he ſo ignorant or fooliſh that would faſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this corruption the prince of immortalitie? ſeeing that the Sacrament is often ſubiect to the eating of Mice or Rats, &amp; apt ſoone to corrupt. I can alledge in teſtimonie of the trueth, that which I ſaw at <hi>Lymoges</hi> in the Couent of the <hi>Iacobins;</hi> the Prouinciall being come thither, found an infinite number of formes or conſecrated ſacrifices, much eaten with Rattes and wormes, wrapt about likewiſe in cobwebs: and againe in the ſaid place, the firſt ſunday after the Octaue (vnder pretence of religion) the Subprior threw downe the box, falſely and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly accuſing thoſe of the true religion reformed; thereby minding to haue maſſacred them as a domeſtical ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the ſaid couent publickly confeſſed, and therfore was whipped in the ſaid towne, &amp; baniſhed the ſame. In <hi>Leride</hi> a goodly town in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the church of the couent of <hi>S.

Maſſe, &amp; conſecrated many Wafers to giue vnto the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants wherof ſundry were left,, whence returning to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, one fell down, which he treading vpon, it claue to his wet feet, without being able any way to pull it off: but was mixed with the durt which could not be wiped away. Foure <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Monkes were hanged in <hi>Seuel,</hi> for that they ſaid Maſſe, and did not purpoſe to conſecrate: ſuch is their extraordinary procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to cauſe the people to become idolaters to the bread and chalice. <hi>Molon</hi> an inquiſitor at <hi>Barſelon,</hi> after the conſecration, did cut the hoſt with ciſſers.

Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. hauing asked the Sacrament touching the reuealing of certaine things againſt the Emperor, &amp; receiuing no anſwer, threw it into the fire. To be ſhort, Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the 3. a Biſhop of <hi>Ebora</hi> and alſo the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the 7. were poyſoned in taking the hoſt and chalice. Loe, theſe are the abſurdities and prodigious actes wherunto tranſubſtantiation would ſubiect the glorious body of our Lord, if it could preuaile. Beſides the <hi>Concomita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie,</hi> which is falſly pretended therein,<note place="margin">Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one kinde.</note> is the occaſion of the peoples pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the cupp againſt the ordinance of Chriſt, who hath commaunded, ſaying, <hi>Drinke yee al.

Now the taſte of the ſubſtance of bread, the ſauour and odour of wine, the inſeperable accidents of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, their true foundation, and wherin they ſubſiſt, doe teach vs that the ſignes abide in their naturall and eſſentiall proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: not in their vſage, which repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vnto vs (as a liuely image and really preſent, and as an inſtrument of Gods grace) the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall food, the quickning refectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the pledge of immortallity to the penitent &amp; faithfull ſoule; bread being the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body, &amp; the chalice ſanctifieng the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the bloud of life, known, receiued, apprehended &amp; applied, aſwell throgh the ſecret operation of the minde in the elect, as through the
<pb facs="tcp:177263:29"/>
efficacie of faith: which is a preſence of things abſent, a viſion of things inuiſible, an hypoſtaſis of the miſteries of eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: Loe this is the truth of this ſacrament, contrary to mans tradition. But time will no more ſuffer me to repeate the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious abſurdities of this tradition.<note place="margin">Purgatory</note> Now of Purgatory which they dote vpon, it is contrary to the waſhing and purging of Chriſt his precious bloud ſhed vpon the croſſe, applyed through vertue and ſecret operation of the ſpirit, and receiued through a liuely faith. But theſe are but Monkiſh abſurdities, to imagyne, that the vnſpeakable dignity of the Sacrifice of Chriſt is not perfectly able to blot out our offences, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile ſoules vnto God, and to iuſtyfie before the throne of iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: it is ſurely a great deminyſhing of his mercy, grace &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable fauour, a too much eclypſing of the inmatchable glory of the Ocean of his compaſſions. I leaue behinde for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity ſake a Chaos of like errours: moſt humbly beſeeching the Lord to haue mercy vpon the ignorant, to enlighten the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his knowledge, and to confound thoſe that maliciouſly warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth. I will be no longer a captiue in <hi>Babilon,</hi> thus to haue no remembrance of <hi>Sion,</hi> nor remember my ſelfe. And for that I cannot ſing the Lords ſong in a ſtrange land, in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious <hi>Babilon,</hi> nor vpon her bankes which do ouerflow with abhominations, I will make riuers of mine eyes with a ſweete remembrance and contemplation of the ſpirytuall <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> notwithſtandyng all aduerſityes, which clenſe vs from viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous imaginations, from all ſuperſtitions and idolatryes, and to the ende I may worſhip one onely GOD, and beleeue in his goſpell, renouncing all humane inuentions: which faith is gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto vs by the holy ghoſt, through the preaching of the holy Goſpell, as it is witten in Saint <hi>Iohn 3. Mathew. Chap. 16. To the Romans, Chap. 10.</hi> and in the <hi>Actes, Chap. 16.</hi> and in many other places, which to ſhun prolixity wee will not now name. This profit therefore commeth of tribulations. And ſurely I may well ſay that which I my ſelfe haue experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a few dayes paſt: wherein I was tormented with an infinite number of imaginations, cauſed in reſpect of the abſence of my
<pb facs="tcp:177263:29"/>
parents, to ſee my ſelfe in a ſtrange countrey, to here the Papiſtes murmure and ordinarily ſpeake againſt me, with threats and ſlaunders; but howſoeuer, I did pray vnto the Lord for thoſe that perſecuted me, and for mine owne comfort and conſolation: for it was the true meane to fortifie me the more in the trueth of the Goſpell, as at this preſent I do with my eyes behold freſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and new effects of the holy ghoſt in my ſoule, bidding me perſeuer in the obedience of the worde of life. This was the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Eſay,</hi> who ſaide; <hi>O Lord, in tribulations we will ſeeke thee:</hi> and of the Prophet <hi>Dauid; Fill their faces with ſhame and reproch, then they will ſeeke thy mercifull name.</hi> By the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Oſee</hi> ſaith GOD himſelfe; <hi>In their troubles and anguiſhes they ſhall riſe vp and acknowledge me.</hi> By <hi>Ezechiell; My Zeale ſhall be taken from thee, and J will ceaſe and will no more be angry with thee.</hi> God giueth vs manifeſtly to vnderſtand in this place, that hee is angrye the more with vs, when hee doth not puniſh and chaſtice vs with tribulations: for then he ſheweth not the loue he beareth vnto vs. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith in the <hi>Apocal: chap. 3. that thoſe whom he loueth he chaſtiſeth:</hi> a great conſolation doubtleſſe. <hi>Eſay. Chap. 43. When thou ſhalt paſſe through the waters, the riuers ſhall not couer thee: and when thou ſhalt tread vpon the fier, it ſhall not burne thee.</hi> This is repreſented vnto vs in <hi>Exodus. 14.</hi> when the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> paſſed through the red ſea: in <hi>Daniel. 3.</hi> when the young men of <hi>Babilon</hi> were caſt into the burning flames. God could well haue hindred them from caſting the three innocent young men into the fire: but he the more to ſhew his mighty glory, and for the ſaluation of his own people, ſuffered them to be throwne into the fier without receiuing any dammage or hurt. In like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Lord doth ſhew greater mercy vnto me, in chaſtiſing me with tribulations, giuing me patience and ſpirituall ſtrength, then if he had deliuered me from the outragious ignominies and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities aboue ſaid. For I well knew that when I was in tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and reſt, he had as it were forgotten me: but ſo ſoone as hee laide his croſſe vpon me, I knew that I was his creature, bought with the ineſtimable price of his owne bloud, who hath iuſtified me, through his vnmeaſurable mercy and heauenly grace. Thus much dooth the ſcripture teach vs, when it ſaith, that the King
<pb facs="tcp:177263:30"/>
of <hi>Babilon</hi> ſaw three young men walke in the middeſt of the fiery flames, ſinging praiſes vnto God; &amp; that they were accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an other, reſembling the ſonne of God. For tribulation taken with patience, procureth God to come to vs and be our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, being free and looſe from papiſticall dignities and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: who with inuentions of rich Altars beautified with idolles of golde, and ſiluer with many thouſands of other ſuperſtitions, doe hinder men from attaining to the true knowledge of the Goſpell or grace.</p>
            <p>The imitation of the Apoſtles, <hi>Actes. 5.</hi> cauſeth wiſe men to reioyce in their afflictions, ſtanding in great feare of proſperity. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> compareth tribulation to <hi>Jonas</hi> his whale: when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thought ſhe ſwallowed him vp to kill him, ſhe ſwallowed him vp to ſaue him. Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, that like as perfumes layd vpon coles, declare their force and good ſmell; ſo men doe ſhew the fortitude of their vertues, paſſing through the flouds of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith, that as woll is to be carded, wherwith fine and pure cloth is to be made ſo muſt the life of the iuſt bee tormented, to the end their knowledge prooue more excellent. Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that vertue ſurmounteth in patiently abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: that affection is the true hauen of heauen, Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> prooues it. God himſelfe in Saint <hi>Mat. Chap. 7.</hi> ſaith, that the way that leadeth to life is ſtraight &amp; narrow: but that which leadeth to death is very large: thereby meaning to inferre, that thoſe who would obtaine glory, muſt firſt paſſe through many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts &amp; difficulties.</p>
            <p>And ſurely it will be an vnſpeakable contentment vnto vs, if wee conſider that thoſe paſſages are by Ieſus Chriſt who is the way of glory: and let vs not wonder, if they be ſet with thornes; but rather thinke and conſider of him who hath firſt paſſed them, and whither hee at laſt reſorted. In the booke of Wiſdome it is written, that the Lorde had made knowne the right way, together with his kingdome, vnto the iuſt. O Lorde I beſeech thee, at this preſent, to ſhewe me the right way, that I erre not. For I doe ſtedfaſtly beleeue, that Ieſus Chriſte li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in mee, aboliſheth the curſe of the lawe, condemneth ſinne, mortifieth death, he alone is peace, comfort, iuſtice, and
<pb facs="tcp:177263:30"/>
life euerlaſting in my hope. Now muſt feare and amazement giue place vnto all theſe: now muſt penſiuenes, and hell it ſelfe depart from mee: Chriſt Ieſus, abiding and liuing in mee, dooth conſume and baniſh all euils that afflicted mee. Hence it comes that this vnion and coniunction is the cauſe that I am deliuered from the terrours ſeperated from the fleſh, tranſformed into Ieſus Chriſt, and into his kingdom? which is the kingdom of grace, iuſtice, peace, ioy, life, health, and euerlaſting glory: ſo that liuing in him there is no hurt can chaunce vnto mee. God promiſed that there ſhould no more come an vniuerſall deluge: and in ſigne of a peaceable loue, he gaue the rainbowe, (a pledge of his mercye) which the Gentiles called <hi>Ianus,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Beroſus</hi> the <hi>Chaldean.</hi> This is that bowe whereof S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> to be ouer the head of Ieſus Chriſt, ſignifying Chriſt crucified, with his armes ſpread abroad. The redde coulour of which celeſtiall bow repreſenteth the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, and his greene colour betokeneth hope: for that in his wounds and bloud remaine all the hope of our good being: and the ſeuerall colours declare vnto vs the multitude of his mercies. This is that token which God the Father promiſed in redemption of the world: whereof Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to <hi>Titus, Chap. 3.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the bountifulneſſe and loue of God appeared,</hi> not in regarde of any workes of iuſtice by vs performed: but he ſaueth vs according to his great mercy. When there ſhall be preſented before mine eyes, the darke clouds of ſinne: when ſorrowes and terrours ſhall with huge violence threaten me: when dangers, perſecutions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries and other torments ſhall come vppon me, then will I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the celeſtiall couenant, I will caſt my eyes vppon Ieſus Chriſt crucified; in whom I ſhall finde plenty of hope. For he is our only refuge, and ſuch a one as Saint <hi>Paule. 2. Corinths,</hi> calleth the <hi>Father of mercie, and God of all conſolation, comforting vs in all our calamities.</hi> Wherefore I will alwayes be running to him, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming my ſelfe with inuincible patience. For the good Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſheweth his experience in dangerous wounds; the phyſition his skil in great maladies; in perilous battels, the prudent, couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; valiant captaine declareth his ſtrength &amp; policy; &amp; in great tempeſts and ſtormes, the expert pilot exerciſeth his diligence.
<pb facs="tcp:177263:31"/>
Affliction is no new thing, neither am I alone he that endures it. <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> ſaith, that if we would conſider that which the Saints haue endured, wee ſhould ſee all our tribulations to be of very ſmall importance: particularly, if we looke vpon and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate Ieſus Chriſt, the true God, tormented vpon the croſſe, wee ſhould perceiue our miſeries in compariſon of his, to be but a drop of water in reſpect of the whole Sea. And <hi>S. Barnard</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt Ieſus is not onely the mirrour of patience, but the recompence and rewarde thereof. To this ende therefore will I contemplate his croſſe, whereby I ſhall reape great comfort and rewarde. But what recompence (ſay the worldlings) wilte thou haue, ſeeing thou haſt forſaken thy countrie, thy parents, thy meanes whereby thou mighteſt haue liued pleaſantly? thou haſt left thy vocation, and all theſe haſt thou abandoned in the pride of thy dayes. Then will I anſwer them, according to the ſaying of Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in his meditations; that if it be a difficult thing for one of the moſt iuſt vnder the law to be ſaued at the point of death; it will be more hard, and as it were, impoſſible for him to be ſaued, that at his death preſents vnto God nothing elſe but his bones, (which dogges refuſe) hauing giuen their fleſh to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, as dayly they doe, employing the time in vaine-glory, in proud ambition, onely delighting in the fleſh, as they are guided by the diuel. But then they wil tell me, that at the houre of death, through vertue of the Popes Bull (ſaying <hi>S. Peter, S. John, S. Paul, S. Caphas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Popes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons.</note> and <hi>S. Macharus</hi> helpe me) they ſhall be ſaued. But if they waite til that time in that beleefe, they ſhall manifeſtly ſee, how God will heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſith they attribute to a mortall creature Gods eternall glory, and place their hope in the Bul of a <hi>Croiſade,</hi> which is highly eſteemed in <hi>Spain,</hi> where euery yere it is bought at ten ſhillings price: by vertue wherof, they are tolerated in Le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t time to eate Egs, Milke, Butter, Cheeſe, and beſides to be abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (as they fondly imagine) from their ſinnes, and aſwell <hi>à culpa,</hi> as <hi>à poena,</hi> that is to ſay, aſwell from their faulte as from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; once in this life, and another time (through Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie) at the houre of death. Beſides this, there is another Bull, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>de los finados,</hi> that is to ſay, of the dead, through which (firſt hauing yearly well paide for the ſame) the party liuing may, for
<pb facs="tcp:177263:31"/>
euery Bul, fetch a ſoule of his friend or parent out of paine. To be ſhort, great ſtore of ſiluer and reuenews is gotten in reſpect of pardons, or the Popes indulgences, who vaunteth that he detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and keepeth treaſure of the bloud of Chriſt and of Martirs. An intollerable and auaritious abuſe doubtleſſe, contrary to holy writ, which certifieth that the mercy of the father of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, preſenteth to the faithfull, forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes to ſaluation, through the vertue of his Holyghoſt, applyed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by a liuely and iuſtifying faith, of euery one beleeuing in Chriſt; who was giuen for our iuſtice, ſanctification and redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dyed for our ſinnes, and roſe againe for our iuſtification. This is all my hope, the foundation of my faith, whereby I may ouercome the terrours of ſinne and death, and enioy eternall life. And againe, of the like corrupted ſtuffe, as the Bulles before mentioned, is the Canonizing of Saints, and deifying them: with whome the ſeelie ignorant people commit idolatrie, and ſpirituall fornication, very impiouſly and incredulouſly againſt GOD, who is onely able to ſaue and reſtore to life thoſe that are dead.<note place="margin">Pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> Hence proceede ſo many pilgrimages into ſtrange countries; vnder pretence wherof, many adulteries, fornications, Sodomies, inceſts, much drunkenneſſe, and other execrable wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked actes are daily committed: and their bodies are adored and ſuperſtitiouſly worſhipped vpon earth, whoſe ſoules oftentimes are tormented in hell. The manner of the Popes proceeding in canonizing many Saints (for the moſt pretended) is very notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For many times ſince the raigne of Poperie,<note place="margin">Canona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſaints.</note> thoſe are placed in this ranke, of whome there remaines no memorie or teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of their life and conuerſation: to the end that through proceſſe of time, and running on of the worlde, there might be conceiued and brought forth a forgetfulneſſe of their vices and enormious crimes, which they might haue perpetrated. And if any dare ſpeake againſt ſuch perſons, endeuouring to bee any hinderance, that vnder ſuch a falſe title, holineſſe and ſanctitie be not attributed vnto them, the Inquiſition knoweth very well how to ſtop his mouth and remedie it, by cruell torments and vntollerable puniſhments. And againe, there want not in theſe kinde of affaires and buſineſſes, gildings, aromaticall ſauours,
<pb facs="tcp:177263:32"/>
pretious ornaments, admirable ſtones, impoſtures, illuſions of ſignes and wonders,<note place="margin">Fained mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> as well in the tombes where the reliques are laide, as in the images and ſtatues erected: which often times, by artificiall motions, do produce teares, to the end that through ſuch kinde of ſpectacles and ſights, the eyes of the ſpectators might be deceiued; a thing ſo familiar and common, that ſuch deceiuers haue many times beene by the lawes puniſhed. To be ſhorte, without entring further into this bottomleſſe pit of a matter ſo lamentable, I will onely ſay, that golde, ſiluer, fauours and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities with the Pope can worke much, for raiſing ſuch perſons into this reputation of holineſſe and deification: which comes not from the ſpirit of ſanctification, but from the authoritie of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and mortall man. For a teſtimonie whereof, note but the thundring brute and fame within <hi>Rome,</hi> in many kingdomes, and within the couents of Monkes, touching the inuention of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites: who haue offered 50000. crownes, employed the credit of Potentates, and ſundry Princes, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> their patron and firſt founder may be canonized. But his curſed remembrance was ſo freſh, that neither he nor any of his diſciples could yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thereunto. Vpon theſe purpoſes of cunning deuiſes, I will not forget the trickes of the Portugall Nun,<note place="margin">Miracles.</note> ſo famous in reſpect of the effects which the diuell wrought in her perſon. Shee, while ſhe prayed, was lifted vp into the ayre, and there ſtayed without any viſible prop. She bare vpon her head the thornes, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the wounds of Ieſus Chriſt, in other partes of her body; by meanes whereof many Princes, Dukes, Lordes, and a number numberleſſe of people came from farre countries to ſee and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore her: But the Lord of truth, in the end, diſcouered this frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent and diabolicall deuice, and the Inquiſition being forced by the euident light of the truth, repreſſed it. Theſe are the Saints and Ladyes, forſooth, their conception and bringing foorth, and their qualities, on whome the Papiſts hope, and at whoſe hands they looke for ſuccours both in life and death. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I vtterly renounce them, and doe onely put all my truſt and confidence in my Creator. As for the abſence of my parents and countrey, I muſt and will yeelde moſt heartie thankes to God almightie, for that hee hath not placed mee in the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall

number, but in the particular number, hauing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne me from the bondage of the deuill, from the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Idoles, from the inuention and errours of men, and in their ſteede hath communicated vnto mee the ineſtimable guifts and graces of his holy Goſpell. And this is very well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in <hi>Geneſis. 12.</hi> when GOD commaunded <hi>Abraham</hi> to come from his countrie, from the houſe of his father, that hee ſhould forſake the world and his owne luſtes and affections, and onely ſeeke a peaceable and quiet life of the minde. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expounding that place, ſaith that he ſhould conuerſe in heauen, to the ende that leauing the conuerſation and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of worldly matters, he ſhould ſpeake with God, and faſten all his thoughtes vpon him Saint. <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, to the <hi>Hebrewes. Chap. 11.</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> went foorth, not knowing whether hee ſhould go, inſinuating thereby, that as ſoone as God had commaunded him to go forth, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtraight wayes obeyed him, not ſeeking anſweres or excuſes: he went and knew not whether, for that he knew not the place, hauing no perſon with him for his guide, but onely his own humble obedience to Gods diuine prouidence. He had a ſonne, whom the Lord commanded to be ſacrificed in the Mounte of <hi>More<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> which ſignifieth the <hi>Mount of deuiſion:</hi> there he was ready with his ſonne <hi>I ſack</hi> to haue kilde him. God might haue charged him to haue ſacrificed his ſon in his owne houſe, but he ordained that he ſhould come forth of his houſe, &amp; ſhould go to the <hi>Mount of deuiſion</hi> with his ſonne alone; which is not without a miſtery. For God meant thereby to note vnto vs, that we ſhould ſacrifice (in the fire of his diuine loue) our owne ſonnes, <hi>videlicet,</hi> our appetites and carnall deſires: for the performance whereof, there is no place more fit and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient then a ſtrange country, hauing left our Parents and ritches behinde vs. This is the high <hi>Mount of diuiſion,</hi> where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout ſoule vieweth many more miſteries, then thoſe who abide belowe in the valley, at the foote of the Mount, at the houſe of their Parents, without climing vp to God-warde, with all their thoughts and affections. Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from ones countrey is more ritch then citties and more glittering than the vniuerſall world:</hi> And ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham</hi> in his <hi>13.

Homily</hi> vpon <hi>Geneſ.</hi> ſaith; <hi>Thinke I pray you, with what loue the Patriarke affected tranquillity, ſeeing he kept it ſo many yeares.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith; <hi>I had rather be the meaneſt in the houſe God, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe in the pallaces of ſinners.</hi> Where Saint <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> by the houſe of God vnderſtandeth a ſtrange land, and a ſeperation from the world. <hi>Iacob</hi> ſeeing himſelfe ouerwhelmed with miſeries, &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> forſooke his originall conuerſation, went from his fathers houſe into a ſtrange country: and taking his way toward <hi>Aran,</hi> he wandered ſo ſolitary and meditating, that being come thither and finding himſelfe weary, he ſat down; and falling a ſleepe, ſaw in a dreame, a heauenly ladder, the one end whereof touched the skies, and the other the earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was the vniuerſall Creator the true ſonne of Iuſtice, the brightneſſe that illuminateth ſoules, and conſumeth all darkenes. In the abſence of the viſible ſunne, there appeared vnto him a ſunne inuiſible: the beame of the ſunne that gaue light vnto his body forſaking him, there came vnto him the beames of the Sun that brought light to his ſoule, changing an outward brightneſſe into an inward light. The Sunne that had created him did ſhyne vnto him. <hi>Iohn. 1. vz.</hi> the Sunne increate, from whoſe light pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede all other lights, as from an euerlaſting light, the fountaine of life and ſaluation. Who, by the ſaid viſion, gaue <hi>Jacob</hi> to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that from him ſhould come the Meſſias, our bleſſed redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: that the firſt degree or ſteppe of this ladder was <hi>Abraham,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Iſaack,</hi> the third <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelfe, and ſo forward all the reſt recounted by Saint <hi>Math. Chap. 1.</hi> vntill Ieſus Chriſt the ſonne of the virgine, who was at the end of the ladder, opening the gates of heauen, which before were ſhut. God was able to haue ſhewed him this miſtery in his fathers houſe, frequenting his friends and kinsfolkes: but he ſhewes not himſelfe but to thoſe that are alone, and haue ſhaken handes with worldly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. By theſe arguments may be ſeene, that the life of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger hath a farre more excellent contemplation (ſeeing his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations are profitable) then the dayly and fond ſtudies of the greateſt Papiſtes and Sophiſters. In the deſart of <hi>Madian Exod. 3, Chap. Moſes</hi> was keeping of ſheepe, when the Lorde appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him in a burning buſh, making him his Ambaſſador, and
<pb facs="tcp:177263:33"/>
Coronell ouer the children of <hi>Iſraell.</hi> Hee was all alone in the Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> farre from dignities or ambitious deſires, when he ſpake with the Almighty, and receiued of him his law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>Eſai</hi> was alone, when he had a viſion of the Lorde of hoſtes: the <hi>Seraphins</hi> with their winges couering themſelues, <hi>Helias, Elizeus,</hi> and the ſonnes of the Prophets walked alone within the deſart conuerſing with God, triumphing ouer the world, rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ambitions, and carnall forces. Others, of whome (ſaith Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes, 11.</hi>) the world was not worthy, conuerſed in mountaines and caues of the earth. What meaneth it, that God hath called many of his ſeruantes from their country and their Parentes, but that thoſe who are of the worlde, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye of them whome GOD loueth? They are brought from the houſe of their fathers into ſtrange countries, there to ſee and behoulde great miſteries. In the wilderneſſe <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was: he, of whome many yeere before <hi>Eſay</hi> had prophecied, <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> that hee was to bee a voyce that ſhoulde preach in the deſart. And Saint <hi>John</hi> the Euangeliſt walked through the Ile of <hi>Patmos,</hi> when God reuealed vnto him the <hi>Apocalips Iohn. Chap. 1.</hi> The Enuch of <hi>Candacis</hi> trauailed through the kingdome of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and comming from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> Saint <hi>Phillip</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him, who declared the holy Scripture vnto him, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and inſtructed him in matters touching faith, as ſaith Saint <hi>Luke Actes. 6.</hi> Hee learned more in an houre, being farre from his countrey, then in all his life tyme continuing at home. And I may truely ſaye aſmuch. For ſo long as I conuerſed at home in my countrey, I neuer knewe ought elſe ſauing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of traditions and humane inuentions, which at the day of iudgement would haue caſt me into deſpaire and perdition: but ſo ſoone as I conueyed my ſelfe to the Goſpell, vnder the winges of grace, farre from my familiars, I learned more in a day, then in all my life time before. For that, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>The greateſt knowledge is, to learne how to be ſaued.</hi> Theſe are the true meanes to know the trueth, <hi>videlicet,</hi> to be drawne from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, from Cardinals, Patriarkes, Biſhops, Abbots, Priors and all their familiarities, as depraued people and vnworthy the perſon of a true Chriſtian. So much doth Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe teach vs;
<pb facs="tcp:177263:34"/>
when he forbare to haue to do with temporal riches &amp; dignities, but conueyed himſelfe into ſolitary places farre from his greateſt friends. And S. <hi>Mathew</hi> in his <hi>4.</hi> chapter ſaith, <hi>He was accompanied with the holy Ghoſt, in goimg from the citty to the deſert.</hi> Thereby noting vnto vs, that it is the holy Ghoſt that retireth vs from cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, from ambitions and other dignities: and contrariwiſe, it is the deuill that inticeth vs and leadeth vs to the citties and Papiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall dignities, and ſuch like worldly affaires. The ſelfe ſame E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt reciteth that the deuill did accompany Ieſus Chriſte when he went into the cittie, to the end to trie if he could cauſe him to fall from the pinnacle of the Temple: becauſe his office is to procure mens fall, through proſperities, greatneſſe, and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the ende to burie them in eternall perdition. This doth the Scripture make knowne vnto vs, when it teacheth that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſraell</hi> leſt the <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> and came to the Toumbes and Sepulchers of deſire and concupiſence. By the <hi>Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> let vs vnderſtand the grace of God: by theſe Iewes, thoſe that forſake the high Mount, and giue themſelues to the lawe, which giue commodities for a ſhort life, but not able to giue vs a neuer-fading glory. For he that hath no hope in grace, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his workes commeth to diſpaire, fearing them to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to ſaue him; as in truth they are. Therefore, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue vpon the earth, we are to conuerſe in the heauens: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead to the world, yet liuing in Ieſus Chriſt, we muſt ſay with the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul, I liue and liue not. But Chriſt liueth in mee.</hi> Hence it comes that <hi>Jeremie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 9.2.</note> the light of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Oh that I had in the wilderneſſe, a cottage of wayfaring men that I might forſake my people.</hi> And this ſpake the Prophet, in declaring his will, and giuing vs to vnderſtand, that it behoueth vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all ambitious glorye, and to imbrace Ieſus Chriſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently: who will bee the true peace in this worlde, a guerdon and crowne in the other, with a happy contentment of felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to all beleeuers in the trueth of his promiſes, hoping in his bounty and power, liuing according to the equity and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of his law, which is a ſweete ſhower comming from his no leſſe admirable then eternall holyneſſe and iuſtice. Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if any one bee deſirous to know what my parents were,
<pb facs="tcp:177263:34"/>
and the publicke charges which I haue exerciſed among the Papiſts before my conuerſion, I will briefely ſatisfie them; not to boaſt or bragge thereof, but to the end to beate downe euery ſlaunder, that may ariſe, whereunto the faithfull are moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſt. My Father was called <hi>Melchior Roman,</hi> a <hi>Fidalgo,</hi> that is to ſay, a Gentleman: and the mother of my Father, <hi>Ferrer,</hi> of the villages of <hi>Frague</hi> and <hi>Caſpe</hi> in the kingdome of <hi>Arragon.</hi> My mother was called <hi>Iſabell Roman,</hi> of the <hi>Baylies</hi> of <hi>Arragon,</hi> ſufficiently renouned and knowne. For from thoſe, are iſſued <hi>Saint Roman</hi> a Martyr and ſouldier, a Cardinall named <hi>Roman,</hi> and S. <hi>Vincent Ferrer,</hi> whoſe body is againe ſuperſtitiouſly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in <hi>Brittain, S. Romain</hi> Biſhoppe of <hi>Balbaſtre,</hi> where he is worſhipped with idolatry. Such canonizations do ſufficiently expreſſe my race, and therefore I thinke it needleſſe to ſpeake any more in that behalfe. As for my charge, accompanying the Inquiſitour <hi>Xamora,</hi> I ſawe at <hi>Saragouſſa</hi> a vertuous perſonage burned for complaining of religion: who as well by his preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant arguments and doctrine, as his conſtancy of martyrdome, perſwaded me to forſake the errours of Papiſtry. This occaſion tranſported me into Fraunce: and beeing arriued in the prouince of <hi>Thoulouſe,</hi> I was very kindly receiued into the couent of <hi>Agen:</hi> and afterward, a Chapter being held in an Ile in <hi>Dodon, Peter Capdeuile</hi> being Prouinciall Preſident there, I was by the conſent of them all, elected Proctor prouinciall to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by a Letter beginning, <hi>Nos infra ſignati, &amp;c.</hi> When I came from <hi>Rome</hi> and had finiſhed my affaires there, the Prouinciall made me his viſitor and prouinciall vicar, as it may appeare by a Letter, the beginning whereof is, <hi>Nos qui infra, &amp;c.</hi> And in the end (ſeeing, and well liking my conuerſation) they made me Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of the Gentlewomen of the little Chappell of <hi>Agen.</hi> But now the Almighty and Father of light be euer praiſed, for that through the grace of his holy ſpirit, he hath opened the eyes of my minde, diſplayed the corruptions of Papiſtrie, made knowne vnto me where I ſhould finde the peace of my conſcience and trueth of my ſoules ſaluation. I render vnto his diuine maieſtie eternall thankes, aboue all other benefits of his large liberality beſtowed vpon me, for this my conuerſion, proteſting to employ
<pb facs="tcp:177263:35"/>
the grace and guifts it hath pleaſed his omnipotencie to endue me withall, to the glorious praiſe of his Maieſtie, the edification of his Church, there where his word is purely preached, his holy Sacraments ſincerely adminiſtred, according to the Lords inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. And here I proteſt vtterly to renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce papiſtry, the Maſſe, errors, and other fond ſuperſtitions, and am diſpoſed to ſpend my bloud and life, for the maintenance of Gods word, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a perfect way to my ſaluation. And therefore according to my example, I exhort all manner of people, deſirous of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, to giue themſelues to the vnderſtanding of the truth, to contemne the worlde, not to feare aduerſitie, to preferre the excellent ioy of eternity, and the glory of the celeſtiall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, before all commodities and worldly vanities; with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent feare, that if they deſpiſe the voice and counſell of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, hardening themſelues in their wickedneſſe, there will be no more place giuen to them for to repent in: but ſhall contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, inſteed of their preſent pleaſures, vanities, and ſoone fading paſtimes, endure moſt horrible and fearefull torments in a place of darkneſſe, where there is nothing but weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. Now God, for his grace, giue vs ſome ſparkes of his heauenly knowledge: that thereby knowing the ſhortneſſe, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie, and calamitie of this preſent life, we may ſeeke to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance and ſet foorth his glorye in the waye of righteouſneſſe, which leadeth vs to his kingdome. So be it. Amen.</p>

though to none other but onely vnto Chriſt it doth appertaine and belong, as being giuen vnto him of God the Father.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, I will omitte very many ſuperſtitions and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, that haue cauſed me to flye from this pretended Catholick Church; to ſettle my ſelfe with al maner of humility in the church reformed (by Gods grace) in this kingdome. I make no doubt, but there are many) the very inſtruments of Sathan,) who enuying my holy reſolution and ſaluation, will drawe out of hell a ſea of ſlaunders, intending thereby the decay of my good fame, and to bring mee into an euill opinion of the faithfull. I knowe they will endeuour to ſpotte my coate of innocencye with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lyes: but time, that reuealeth all things, ſhall ſhew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>One thing comforteth me: which is, that if our head Ieſus Chriſt hath receiued many opprobious ſpeeches, the faithfull who are his elected members, ſhoulde not deſire to bee exempt from the ſame, ſeeing it is the meane to attaine to heauen? Let them ſay what they will, let them doe what they can neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, nor threats, neither iniuries, nor perſecutions, nor the ſword, can (through Gods grace) with-drawe me from my holy reſolution; which is to imbrace the true and liuely faith of the reformed Churches: aſſuring my ſelfe, that GOD (who hath euer care of his poore faithfull) will be a ſufficient buckler to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me againſt all their aſſaults. It remaineth now, that with all humility I do beſeech the congregation of the faithful to receiue me into their number: with whom I deſire to finiſh the reſidue of my dayes; to the end, with them, I may freely ſerue my God, and walke according to the ſincerity of his Goſpell.

As for vs (illuminated with the ſacred life of the diuine trueth) we eſteeme all this, and the like brauery, as a thing of naught, a periſhable vanity, vnworthy of true religion, vncapable of leading to ſaluation; in ſuch ſort, that thoſe who are buſied, or rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by ſuch worldly inticements, do leaue (behind) the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of piety, and ſpirituall worſhippe. And (to iudge truly) thoſe who are dazeld with ſuch an appearance, doe onely feede their outward ſenſe: not at all vnderſtanding the ritch ornaments or rather celeſtiall enrichments of the city of the liuing God. For, the wiſedome of the children of this world is abhominable folly before the Soueraigne onely wiſe God. That which man (ſeely creature) doth vndiſcretly admire, is ougly and execrable before the eyes of the eternall: and that which the foole (ſwolne in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) contemneth, is certainely great and admirable. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hereof haue dayly experience, to their vnſpeakeable comfort And with them, wee (thrice happy at this preſent) doe enioy full matter of ſolace and gratious delectations; hauing our eyes clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the beams of the eternal ſonne of iuſtice, ſo that we may contemplate in the houſe of God (through this influence of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame grace, or at leaſt the illumination of the celeſtiall light) the moſt ſweet felicities of his face, the word of life, the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, the efficacie of the exerciſes of piety, the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a liuely faith, the vertues of the holy ghoſt, and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite bleſſings, inſpired from heauen into the elect in the miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſociety of the body of Chriſt: which are as chriſtalline mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, conteyning a quickning brightneſſe of the bounty, fauour, beatitude, eternity, power, mercy, wiſdome and heauenly life, in ſteede of the horrour of darkeneſſe, of helliſh torments, of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the ſecond death, wherinto the error of humane inuentions do throw vs headlong, with a perpetuall deſpayre.

as the glory of our Sauiour is vnſeparably conioyned with the ſaluation of his elected and choſen creatures, honouring and crowning with ineſteemable benefits thoſe that honour him: So likewiſe, that is the true and ſincere Religion opening the waye to ſaluation, which addreſſeth all her documents, and exerciſes, purely and ſimply to the glory of the almighty: and contrarywiſe that religion is falſe and ruinous, which ſeeketh the glory of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; honoring them with that which onely belongeth to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, who giues not his glory to any other.

What mans eares, that bee attentiue to any wholeſome doctrine, and ſtirred vp with the affection of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian zeale, can endure and ſuffer the eccho of ſo harſh and horrible a ſpeech? What ſoule is there, which is deſirous to aſpire &amp; come to her true ſcope &amp; felicity,<note place="margin">Math. 17</note> through the true and ſacred mediator Chriſt Ieſus,<note place="margin">Math. 23. Deut. 18. Eſai. 11.</note> that can permit his excellencies and dignities to be ſo trampled vnderfoote? The Church of Rome is not content to baniſh Chriſt out of the ſanctuary (whereas the Iewes haue caſt him onely out of the Synagogue) but goeth on further, and taketh from him his paſtorall robe: which appertaineth and belongeth vnto him alone, as it may euidently appeare in many places of the holy Scripture: wherein he is promiſed and recommended for a Doctor and maiſter, giuing lawes and precepts againſt which or beſides which (as proceeding from a moſt wiſe maiſter) none of his deſciples dare thruſt themſelues in, for their alteration. This <hi>Maxim</hi> (againſt which the very heathens dare not diſpute) decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſufficiently, that he, who is a meanes for conducting me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Soueraigne good, muſt alſo by his inſtructions and precepts lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the way and aſſured meanes for the attayning thereunto.</p>
            <p>The Church of Rome yet notwithſtanding vſurpeth and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth to her ſelfe the Soueraigne authority of iudging ſuch like inſtructions, &amp; accuſeth them of inſufficiency,<note place="margin">Popes Doctrine.</note> as not able to ſhew the way leading to eternall life: which ſurely is nothing els but an accuſing of the author himſelfe, Chriſt Ieſus the ſon of God. Nay ſhe yet goeth beyond and farre ſurmounteth the ſaid precepts, as well in the vertue of her word not written, as of her traditions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an Iliad of inuenſions, rather diabolicall then deuine or humane. And moreouer ſhe teacheth doctrine cleane contrary to Gods truth, as may be noted in theſe few examples: Ieſus Chriſt forbiddeth any of his deſciples to deſire preheminence ouer the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The Church of Rome hath a counterpoiſe,<note place="margin">Math. 24.</note> for ſhe conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth one in authority aboue all the Biſhops in the worlde. Chriſt Ieſus will that his Church take her firme foundation vpon this that <hi>he is Chriſt, the ſonne of the liuing God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 16.16.18.</note> who ſuffereth not <hi>the gates of hell to preuaile againſt her,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chruch not built vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Peter.</note> for that ſhe is grounded vppon a ſure rocke, which is Chriſt: The Church of Rome will builde her vpon a rocke which (like vnto man) is ſubiect to fall awaye and
<pb facs="tcp:177263:45"/>
come to ruine (I meane during the life of S. <hi>Peter</hi>) as may be ſeene how the flouds of misbeleiefe and riuers of infidelity haue had great power ouer her, and brought her flat vpon the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Carued Images.</note>To be ſhort, all the doctrine of our ſaluation, as well in the olde as new Teſtament, forbiddeth vs to draw or paint any images or ſtatutes in matter of religion: yet notwithſtanding the Church of Rome obſtinatly alloweth them, will haue them, and commaund them. Finally in conferring the one with the other, you may ſee as it were in a glaſſe, that <hi>Belial</hi> is no more contrary to Chriſte, falſhood to truth, darkneſſe to light, vice to vertue, then the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church of Rome to that of the Mediator and acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to the Soueraigne good. Beholde then Chriſt Ieſus in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church deueſted of his doctorall robe.</p>
            <p>Now remaines the third and laſt dignity of his vnction: that is to ſay, that he is <hi>King,</hi> hauing all power both in heauen &amp; earth (as it is proued by diuerſe places of the holy Scripture; namely in the <hi>49.</hi> of <hi>Geneſ.</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Iuda</hi> in the <hi>11.</hi> of <hi>Eſay.</hi> in the <hi>31.</hi> of <hi>Ieremy, Pſal. 2. Pſal. 110. Mathew 23.</hi>) of the which he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſpoſſed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For, whoſoeuer ſaith that he hath both ſpirituall and temporall power to gouerne the Church <hi>Triumphant</hi> and <hi>Militant,</hi> to doe with them according to his pleaſure, he doth ſurely take vpon him the true dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>I giue the water of life, and who ſo ſhall drinke thereof,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 4.10.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall neuer haue thirſt:</hi> by which ſpeciall paſſion of <hi>thirst,</hi> he comprehendeth all other (ſpiritually) by the figure <hi>Synedoche.</hi> This is that which the Apoſtle expoundeth, and the Euangeliſt in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> ſpeaking of Saints who haue waſhed their robes in the bloude of the Lambe,<note place="margin">Apoc. 21.</note> and doe no more taſte of lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſorrowes, or any other kinde of paſſions or torment. It bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth therefore onely to the vndefiled Lambe, who giueth the water of life, to make and canonize true Saints. But the Pope, who is the head of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> taketh vppon him au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye and power to create Saints and canonize them: hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouleth, in the booke of heauen, ſuch as he will: and when it is his good pleaſure, hee maketh them to raigne with Chriſt Ieſus in the like title and degree, as himſelfe: he vaunteth to haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer Angels to command them: nay which is more, one of his
<pb facs="tcp:177263:45"/>
bookes named <hi>Stella Clericorum</hi> dooth affirme that the meaneſt Prieſt among them,<note place="margin">Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Angels.</note> is greater in dignity then the holy Virgin and all the Angels. How much greater then is the Creator of Prieſts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope? Oh ſhameleſſe vanity: <hi>Non Stygius tentaret Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, quod audent effrenes monachi.</hi> Againe, euery one may eaſilye know what authority he taketh in the Church Militant, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating ſome, anathematizing others: he taketh the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſword, hee pulleth downe kinges and Monarches from their thrones, he ſetteth his foote vpon their necks, and commonlye makes them kiſſe his pantable. I omit to ſpeake of the exceſſiue dignities attributed vnto him by his owne <hi>Canons, Decrees, Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Clementines</hi> (being truely extrauagant from all truth) as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a thouſand more points of doctrine iſſuing out of theſe three principals: That Chriſt Ieſus is deueſted of his office of Sacrificer in the Roman Church, that his office of Doctorſhip is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, that his gouernement in heauen and earth is vſurped from him. Now, ſeeing theſe offices are neceſſary adiacents to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne good, &amp; that the Church of Rome diuorceth them from the Mediator, it muſt needes be that ſhe doth not ſeeke the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good, but rather ſhuns and flyes from it.</p>
            <p>Hence therfore it comes, brethren, that I haue renounced Papiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and doe purpoſe carefully and with labour to ſeeke the right pathes leading to the Soueraigne good, wherwith the Church of Rome is not acquainted. And for this purpoſe I haue abiured, and do now abiure al her doctrine, as blaſphemous, Apoſtaticall, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and as farre from Chriſtianity, as ſhe is from the true ende and ſcope of mans creation; which is, the Soueraigne good.</p>
            <p>And finally, aboue all other graces wherewith God of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy hath made me pertaker, I yeelde him moſt humble thankes for theſe two (which are farre beyond compare of all others) <hi>videlicet,</hi> that hee hath ſhewed vnto mee through the light of the holye Ghoſt the natural brightneſſe of his holy truth, &amp; that the cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof cauſeth his beames to ſhine in the Churches of this kingdome, reformed both in faith and doctrine, according to the pureneſſe and ſincerity of his holy Goſpell. The confeſſion of whoſe faith I will not onely ſeale with pen and inke vpon paper, but alſo if neede be againſt tyrants, with my bloud, vpon this baſe

Territority. In which reformed Church I proteſt to dye and finiſh my dayes: praying the Lord Almighty and onely wiſe, who hath called me to the knowledge of his truth, that he will eſtabliſh &amp; ratifie this vocation of me, and make me to feele and perceiue the full effects of his eternall election: and further, that of his mercye he will ſtrengthen and aſſiſt me, againſt all aſſaults and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may preſent themſelues before me.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, I hartily beſeech this Church to make mee pertaker of her holy praiers: as I will in like ſort be euer mindefull as well to powre forth prayers to the eternall, for her long &amp; proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous continuance, as alſo for thoſe that are of the like faith in Ieſus Chriſt.

As for me I may ſay the like, not only that I was detained in <hi>Egipt</hi> (for <hi>Egipt</hi> is by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation darkneſſe) but alſo vnder the ſeruitude and captiuity of a <hi>Pharao,</hi> and more. For <hi>Pharao</hi> did not exerciſe his power and cruelty, but in ruling ouer the temporall bodies and goods, But he of whome I intende to ſpeake, will rule both ouer our bodies, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:177263:49"/>
our ſoules, &amp; our goods, meaning himſelf &amp; cauſing others to cal him Gods lieutenant vpon earth and Lord of heauen &amp; earth. Which he ſheweth in effect, when he ſanctifieth and canonizeth ſome, enroling them in the booke of heauen, anathematizing, and excomunicating others being in the Church militant, taking the ſword againſt kings and Monarches, willing to depoſe and bring them to nothing,<note place="margin">Sixtus quintus.</note> as it well appeareth by a Bull, which <hi>Sixtus quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> made in the yeare 1585. againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> and now our king. And againſt <hi>Henry</hi> prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> in confiſcating all their temporall goods preſent and to come. To the end that you may vnderſtand the holines of this Pope <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus quintus</hi> laſt deſeaſed, I can aſſure you, that I being at Rome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly, talking with a Monke of the order of Saint <hi>Benit,</hi> priour of his monaſtery, asking him how they proceeded in the election of the Pope, he anſwered me that there was nothing but bribery, fauours and ambition, reciting vnto me that it was found to be true,<note place="margin">The Popes bargaine.</note> that th'aforeſayd Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> v. Made a bargen with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, giuing himſelfe vnto him, vpon this condition that he ſhould be Pope ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> years. It ſo happened that vpon the end of the ſixth yeare or the beginning of the ſeuenth, a Neuiew of his in Rome, had a quarrell againſt a great Lord which was very yong, and the ſaid yong Lord ſlue the Popes Neuiew. Being apprehended and taken by iuſtice, the Pope commanded him to be put to death, the Iudges of the law anſwered, that he was not yet of age competent according to their laws, he asked how much there wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that there yet wanted one yeer: then ſaid the Pope, go put him to death by and by, I can do all; I giue him one of my yeeres. Inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinent this being done, behold a veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t feuer with a franſie tooke holde and ſeiſed on the ſaid Pope, &amp; the deuil came &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelfe vnto him, in the ſhape and forme of a black man, who tooke him by the arme &amp; ſaid vnto him, <hi>Let vs go:</hi> the Pope anſwereth he knew him not; but he ſaid, I am the deuill to whom thou gaueſt thy ſelfe to be Pope. Then the Pope ſaide vnto him, there reſteth to me yet one yeere. The deuill anſwered him, thou gaueſt it to the yong man which killed thy neuiew, for to put him to death, and then he departed and dyed in this ſort. And as for his behauiour who now raigneth. I haue ſeene him &amp; conſidered of
<pb facs="tcp:177263:49"/>
him, hauing vpon his head a triple crown, where is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon his forehead in precious ſtones the word <hi>Miſtery.</hi> For the reuerence which muſt be borne &amp; done vnto him, whoſoeuer wil ſpeak with him, muſt preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, ſo ſoone as he is permitted to enter into his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſet him on his knees, &amp; ſo come vnto him, to the end to adore him, &amp; this being done, returne in the ſame maner vpon his knees. I marked alſo another thing, which is, that being in the citty of <hi>Beulogne</hi> I ſaw a great multitude of people going to the church to adore the body of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called the happy <hi>Katherin</hi> of <hi>Bouloigne,</hi> I asked them wherefore they did not call her Saint, they anſwered for that ſhe was not yet canonized nor ſanctified by the Pope, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where the fault was; they anſwered me that the fault was in the Monkes by reaſon that there muſt be good ſtore of gold &amp; ſiluer to do it, ſhewing thereby that the Pope doth nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, the like is found in the citty of <hi>Auignon,</hi> in the monaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of the <hi>Celeſtins,</hi> of the body of S. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Luxembrough,</hi> which is not yet ſanctified nor canonized for want of mony. I haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked moreouer, that in ſundry Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> the Pope hath giuen ſuch power &amp; priuiledge to ſome aultars,<note place="margin">Priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> (which they call priuiledged aultars) to deliuer ſoules from purgatory, that in ſaying one only Maſſe, before the ſaid priuiledge altar, he aſſureth that a ſoule is deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> purgatory. Now I leaue to you to think if it were ſo that there were a Purgatory, what need ſhold there be to ſay ſome times ſo grear nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Maſſes, that the means of the deceaſed are not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to pay the prieſts, if one only Maſſe (as a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>foreſaid) being ſaid before the ſaid aultar, be ſufficient for his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. I beleeue that this which they do is to fulfill the prophecie of <hi>Eſay,</hi> which ſaith <hi>they eate the ſinnes of my people, &amp; deſire no other thing but the iniquity therof.</hi> I haue noted alſo a great blaſphemy, in as much as they affirme in a booke called <hi>Stella clearicoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> that the leaſt of the prieſts is greater then the holy virgin, or any Angel which is in heauen, which they ſhew by their effects, ſaying that they can pardon and remit ſins, in making vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> auriculer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, ſhewing therby that if they could, they woulde plucke the paſtoral rod out of the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the Lord, wherwith he ruleth &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth his folk. It ſeemeth to me vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this diſcourſe, that I cannot better co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare, neither the Pope nor the prieſts, then to <hi>Lye,</hi> which
<pb facs="tcp:177263:50"/>
hath this property, to whiten linnen, and as for it ſelfe it remaineth ougly &amp; filthy: for they boaſt that they clenſe others fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſins, although they themſelues bee impure, and I ſtedfaſtly beleeue that if the Popes ambition were accompliſhed, to witte, to haue dominion ouer bodyes, ouer ſoules, and ouer the temporall goods, there would reſt nothing els to do but make a new religion after his fantaſie. You ſhall further knowe, that if it ſo happen that the Mule which carryeth him dye, it muſt be buried and enterred for feare that the Wolues and dogs eate him not: I beleeue that they feare if that ſhould come to paſſe, they ſhould be ſanctified hauing eaten of ſo worthy a beaſt, as to haue borne Gods lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vpon earth. I beleeued according as it was told me, that when I ſhould be in <hi>Italy,</hi> I ſhoulde be halfe way to Paradice. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing perceiued the contrary by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I beleeue rather that I was already in the Suburbs of hell. But God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me the grace to drawe my feete backe; and after the example of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I purpoſe to marche three dayes iourney, and to go out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> I meane out of darkeneſſe, knowing that ſo long as I ſhould ſtay there, all the ſacrifices which I ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto him, would not be acceptable vnto him, but rather abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. The Sacrifice which I deſire to offer vnto God for my firſt dayes iorney, is a Sacrifice of praiſe with a contrite hart, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> defineth, contriſion is a griefe proceeding from the grace of God, voluntarily taken according to the quality and quantity of the offences, with purpoſe of amendment. And S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſaid; God requireth of vs onely a ſacrifice of praiſe, and to be new creatures in Ieſus Chriſt. And S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, that there is not any ſacrifice more acceptable vnto God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is mainteined in innocencie, and that the wicked leaue his wickedneſſe, that we ſhoulde haue contrition for our faultes: vnreaſonable beaſts themſelues, doe teach and ſhew vs: for the naturall Philoſophers report, that there is a Foule, meruelous great and very cruell, reſembling in the face a Man, (which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Harpia,</hi>) who ſometimes conſtrained through hunger falleth vpon a man and killeth him, and then eateth him: which when he hath done being dry, he flieth to the waters and Riuers to drinke, and in ſo doing he ſeeth and beholdeth himſelfe, and thereby
<pb facs="tcp:177263:50"/>
remembreth that hee hath killed one like to himſelfe: And the Philoſophers ſay, that ſometimes hee is ſo diſpleaſed therewith, that he dieth of griefe. With greater reaſon, I which am, or ought to be a reaſonable man, ought to haue contrition &amp; repentance, not for hauing killed the bodyes, but rather for hauing loſt the Soules, hauing giuen them aſſurance of their ſaluation, going to proſtrate themſelues before a Crucifix of Wood, or ſome other Marmoſet: and ſaying ſome <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> or <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> that their offences were forgiuen them, which is blaſphemie: for it appertaineth to God onely to forgiue.</p>
               <p>It ſufficeth not to haue traueiled this firſt iourney of contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but I muſt paſſe further and come to the ſecond, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to God, to obtaine pardon of him according as ſaith. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid: I haue ſaid I will make confeſſion of my ſinnes to the Lorde, and thou haſt pardoned the iniquitie of my ſinne: S. Auguſtin</hi> vpon the 103. Pſalme hath theſe words; <hi>Diſcouer thy ſelfe to God who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee, confeſſion is acceptable vnto him.</hi> And againe, <hi>The confeſſion of ſynnes, ſheweth the ſore to the Phiſytion, and the confeſſion of praiſe yeeldeth him thanks for health.</hi> Being now in the houſe of the Lord, betweene the armes and in the boſome of his deere ſpouſe. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and renounce all ſuperſtition, abhomination and Idolatrie, proteſting and promiſing from henceforth to liue and to dye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his holy Goſpell, in dooing and beleeuing that which the reformed church dooth and beleeueth. And foraſmuch as of myſelfe I am able to do nothing, I pray him, of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to giue me ſtrength and power, to put in execution that which I now haue promiſed, all to his glory, to the ſaluation of my ſoule, and the edification of his church. <hi>So be it.</hi>

Cor. 1.30. But ye are of him in Chriſt Ieſus, who of God is made vnto vs wiſedome and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. That, according as it is written, he that reioyceth, let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the Lord:</hi> Whereof the Apoſtle teſtifieth in the 9. to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> making a compariſon betweene the ſacrifices of the olde Teſtament, with the ſacrifice of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the difference of the one to the other, oppoſing the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and mutability of the one (for they were renewed euery yeare) to the perfection of the eternity of the ſacrifice of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore reade the new Teſtament ouer and ouer, you ſhall finde no where one word, I ſay not onely of the Maſſe, which is an inuention of Satan, but neither of any Propetiatory ſacrifices, of what kinde ſoeuer they be, but of the onely ſacrifice of Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 110.4</note> who being anoynted of God his father to bee an eternall prieſt according to the order of <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> hath vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily giuen ouer himſelfe vnto the death, and for euer recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb facs="tcp:177263:57"/>
vs with God the father. If then the matter be thus cleare, what ſhall our Docters reply to maintaine their Maſſe, which is vtterly conuicted by theſe places of the holy Scripture, for they cannot hold the words of the Apoſtle for trueth, vnleſſe they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelues of this their abuſe: the reaſon is euident, for if the Leuiticall ſacrifices haue beene vnperfect, and not ſufficient to waſh away the ſinnes of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to iterate &amp; renew them often, how much the more ſhall the Sacrifice of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt bee of ſmall eſtimation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God his father, when, not onely euery yeare, but alſo euery day, yea almoſt euery houre, it muſt needes by a prieſt be it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated and renewed. And loe this is the doctrine of that great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car of Ieſus Chriſt, of his Biſhops, and Suppoſts, or Cardinals &amp;c. Conſider once the ſubſtance of this faire ſacrifice which is figured in the Maſſe, but why do I call it a ſacrifice, ſeeing it is nothing els but a manifeſt deuiſion of Chriſt and his merites, for as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb. 7.22. Where no ſhedding of blood is, there is no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Marke once briefly the doctrine wherewith they nouriſh the people, when they ſpeake concerning ſaluation, they keepe them depending on their tradition, and merits of men, where the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contrariwiſe teſtifieth moſt euidently, that we cannot pleaſe God in any ſort of our ſelues or by our merits, but that we obtaine ſaluation onely by faith, &amp; that it is his pure goodneſſe, as we read in the 3.4.5. and 10. <hi>chap.</hi> to the <hi>Romanes.</hi> and in the 2. &amp; 3. to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> where the Apoſtle excludeth cleerely all theſe comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors, when he ſayes, <hi>By grace are ye ſaued through faith, and that not of your ſelues: it is the gift of God: Not of workes, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt himſelfe.</hi> &amp; in the 3. to the <hi>Phillipians verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>I eſteeme</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of his owne perſon, (hauing thouſand times more reaſon to boaſt of perfection and holineſſe of his workes, then our Papiſts haue now a dayes) <hi>I eſteeme</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>all things but loſſe for the excellent knowledge ſake of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord, for whom I haue counted all things loſſe, and doe iudge them to be doung, that I might winne Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shall we deſire a cleare and manifeſt teſtimony for to humble our ſelues before God, and ſo to lift vp our harts vnto God, for to
<pb facs="tcp:177263:58"/>
craue mercy from him? But the wickedneſſe of the Romiſh clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy is ſo great, and the poore people is ſo blinded, that they neuer examine themſelues and the vnworthineſſe of their merrites which be not at all, yea inſteed that they ſhould cry out with the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in his 143. <hi>Pſalm. verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant: for in thy ſight ſhall none that liueth, be iuſtified.</hi> they flatter themſelues, &amp; bring to an account before God, their merrites and worthineſſes to be ſaued by them, or at leaſt partly. Wherein we haue to marke the great deceitfulneſſe of Satan, who knowing our ſickneſſe, and our weaker part, and obſeruing that men by nature is giuen to an idle preſumption &amp; pleaſing of themſelues, and that man flatters commonly himſelfe, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds vnto him his merrites and good workes, to this end, that putting his confidence on the ſame, hee might forget to imbrace the grace of God, which ſaueth vs in Ieſus Chriſt, and therefore if any doctrine be mingled with the deceite of Satan,<note place="margin">Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by merrits the deuills Doctrine.</note> it is this doctrine, namely of the iuſtification of the poore ſinner before God: for if he could once take away the trueth of this Doctrine, (which is the foundation of our ſaluation) he might ſoone come to the ende of his purpoſe and intent, ſeeing that without this, there is no more any life for the poore ſinner, no mercy, no coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, no promiſe: but (in a word) eternall damnation, if we will truſt in any manner on our ſelues, or haue opinion onely of any merrite.<note place="margin">The death of Papiſts, a good thing to obſerue.</note> From whence, I pray you come ſo many ſobs, ſo much weeping, ſo many teares, and to be ſhort, ſuch an vnbeliefe, and incertitude of ſaluation in the article of death, not only amongſt the common people, but alſo amongſt the Prieſt and teachers, yea ſuch a deſpaire, that they condemne themſelues, hauing no feeling of the ſalutary grace of God, is not the reaſon becauſe they conſidering and diligently examining their owne workes, finde nothing that can ſubſiſt before ſuch a iuſt iudge? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye it is ſo, for they are all but infirmities and ſtinking polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And this is the conſolation which they can get by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of their merits and good workes in the laſt breath of this life. By and by followeth the laſt ſaluing or vnction (as they call it) done by a Prieſt, who waſheth and purgeth with an holyed and conſecrated Oyle, the poore ſick man of his ſinnes, then come

the waxen Candels which burne day and night before the graue, the ringing of Bels, Maſſes, Vigiles, <hi>De prefundis, &amp; Requieſcant in pace:</hi> and ſuch like Ape-play. Theſe things are rather vnto them Needels to prick their conſciences, ſeeking conſolation in things which are of no valour, in ſteede of taking their refuge to the blood of Chriſt which purgeth vs of all our ſinnes, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſaith 1. Epiſt. 1. verſe 18. And thus is the common people ſeduced and brought to their euerlaſting perdition by theſe deceiuers and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers of ſoules: beholde this is the ſweete conſolation, which they haue to weapon themſelues againſt the battle of death and Sathan. Beholde this is the reſt and peace of their conſciences in the end of their liues. Beſides this vnbeleefe and diffidence wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are tormented, being vncertaine of their owne ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſee nothing but paine and torments prepared for them, being tranſmitted (ſoone after death) to a Purgatorie (which is the more rediculous, becauſe it can be found no where) for to doe their penance and repent, to the end that the poore ſoules which haue not merited enough in this worlde, ſhould ſuffer there for a certaine time the paines of Purgatorie, being roaſted in a fire, the one more, the other leſſe, for to come at laſt to heauen, and deſerue eternall ſaluation.</p>
               <p>But for to diſcouer ſomewhat better their errors and abuſes,<note place="margin">The ſinne of Romiſh Doctors.</note> how ſhall the Doctors of the Romiſh Church be able, to excuſe themſelues before God, ſeeing they turne not onely the people from the true worſhipping of God, but commaund them alſo to worſhip creatures, and take their recourſe to Saints and Sainteſſes, to be mediators betweene God and them in all their neceſſities and defects. A doctrine flatte contrarie to the holy Scriptures: for examine the holy Scripture from leaſe to leaſe, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end, you ſhall finde no commaundement to do it, nor promiſe, nor example of any that haue done it, neither in the olde nor new Teſtament, as thoſe of the Romiſh Church do, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infected with plague, take their recourſe with prayer to Saint <hi>Andrew,</hi> or to Saint <hi>Rocquis,</hi> being in tempeſt in feare of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, they take recourſe to Saint <hi>Nicholas,</hi> or Saint <hi>Clemens,</hi> and ſo foorth, according to the diſeaſes or euils which come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. And is not this it that the Scripture condemns, ſhowing
<pb facs="tcp:177263:59"/>
as though it were with a finger we muſt inuocate and worſhip: The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in his 18. Pſalme verſe. 2. ſaith: <hi>The Lord is my rocke, and my fortreſſe, and he that deliuereth me, my God and my ſtrength: in him will I truſt, my ſhielde, the horne alſo of my ſaluation, and my refuge.</hi> And in the 3. Pſalme, verſe. 5. <hi>I layde me downe and ſlept, and roſe vp againe, for the Lord ſuſtained me. I will not be afraide for ten thouſand of the people.</hi> Beſides theſe are yet innumerable places of Scripture propounded vnto vs, to demonſtrate, that we muſt not truſt vpon the might and arme of man, nor looke for any helpe of creatures, but that we muſt take our courſe vnto God onely, who can, doth, and will, deliuer vs from all euils.</p>
               <p>But is not this an impudencie (ſay they) and too great a bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to appeare ſo before God, without crauing firſt the meanes or interceſſion of ſome Saint? I would faine that they ſhould anſwer me whether it be preſumption or boldneſſe to obey vnto God, and to follow his commaundement: I thinke not that they be ſo impudent, but they muſt confeſſe ſo much. Conſidering then that we haue this commaundement in the holy Scripture, that in all neceſſities we muſt take our refuge to God with a true and liuely faith, and with a ſure and vndoubted aſſurance to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that which we pray for at his hands, as clearely is written in the 50. Pſalme of the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> verſe. 15. <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble: ſo will I deliuer thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> And the Apoſtle Hebrew. 4. verſe 16. <hi>Let vs goe boldly therefore vnto the throne of grace, that we may receiue mercy, and finde grace to helpe in time of neede.</hi> And if we ſeeke a mediator betweene vs and the Father, we muſt not runne to Saints, for Chriſt dyed for vs, yea more, he is riſen, and ſitteth at the right hand of God, and prayes for vs, which the Apoſtle explicates in the 8. to the Roma. 24. ver. <hi>For we are ſaued by hope: but hope that is ſeene, is not hope: for how can a man hope for that which he ſeeth?</hi> and in Hebrew. 9. verſ. 24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the holy places that are made with hands, which are ſimilitudes of the true Sanctuarie: but is entred into very heauen, to appeare now in the ſight of God for vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt therefore goe to him in all our neceſſities, by him ſhall we obtaine mercy, he is (to be breefe) our aduocate by the father, offering vnto him our prayers. Let vs therefore not runne to
<pb facs="tcp:177263:59"/>
creatures, and call vpon them in our neede. Let vs not robbe God of his honour onely due vnto him, to deferre the ſame to anye other, but let vs follow that rule of well praying, which Chriſt teacheth vs <hi>Matth. 6.</hi> Let vs in all ſuretie by the vertue of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, go to God our Father, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſuredly that nothing ſhall faile vs, if we faile not in our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, God is true in his promiſes, to whome I will take my refuge.</p>
               <p>Concluding therefore my rehearſe, I will giue him praiſe and thankes for all his exceeding great benefites, which I confeſſe to haue receiued from his gracious mercie, that he hath brought me, that was gone aſtray from the right way of ſaluation, &amp; was departed from his tabernacle, to his Church: clearing the eyes of my vnderſtanding for to enioy the light of his holy Goſpell, and the trueth of his holy worde, and to renounce to all errors and ſuperſtitions of the children of darkeneſſe, in the which hetherto I haue beene ſmothered.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe heere before God, and his holy congregation, that with a ſincere &amp; vpright mind and hart, I forſake from hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all Popery and their ſuperſtitious Apoſtaticall blaſphemous doctrine, and abhominable &amp; damnable errors which they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe yet daily, in the which I haue liued too long a time, feeling my ſelfe now inuited to the ſalutary knowledge of the trueth.
